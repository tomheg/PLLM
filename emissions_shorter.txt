Time really flies, autumn will be over in the blink of an eye, and winter will be here again. The temperature will get lower and lower, so you'll have to wear more clothes when you come out to train.

没错，这些企业不但生产方式落后，投入产出比例失衡，而且是以破坏生态环境为代价来换取经济效益。

That's right, those heavy-polluting firms release so much polluted water and waste gas every day, seriously polluting what was once the blue sky and crystal-clear water, should have been dealt with long ago.

这个我有体会，现在城市的公交车遍布各个角落，班次也排得满满的，到哪都能公交出行，还有几条地铁线也开通了，生活确实方便了很多。
I've had experience of that, now the city has public transport spread through every corner, and the schedules are really packed, you can go anywhere by public transport, and even some subway lines have now opened, so life is a lot more convenient.
